## 🌱 Ways to contribute

| Contribution | First action |
| --- | --- |
| 🐛 Reproducible defect | Open an issue with exact commit, environment, expected and observed behavior, and synthetic evidence. |
| ✨ Model or feature change | Open an issue defining the methodological basis, observable contract, compatibility, non-goals and validation. |
| 📐 Estimator or calibration change | State the reference implementation, tolerances, convergence criteria and failure behavior before writing code. |
| 🧪 Test or evidence improvement | Explain provenance, independence, coverage and what failure the test detects. |
| 📖 Documentation | Identify the authoritative document being corrected. |
| ⚙️ Tooling or governance | Explain failure behavior, portability, trust boundary and maintenance cost. |
| 🔐 Security concern | Follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) privately. |

Open issues with the forms (bug, feature, documentation). Every issue is
assigned to `danielep71`, carries **exactly one** priority label (`P1`, `P2` or
`P3`) and has a milestone; the forms set the first two, and triage sets the
milestone. See [`docs/GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/GOVERNANCE.md#issue-metadata). Pull
requests follow [the PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## 🌿 Development workflow

1. Start from the active release branch, currently `release/0.1.0`. Never assume
   GitHub's default branch is the right base.
2. Create one focused task branch named in the repository convention:
   `fix/<issue>-<slug>`, `docs/<slug>` or `test/<slug>`.
3. Reproduce the current behavior before changing it.
4. Define the observable contract, affected callers, compatibility impact and
   validation plan.
5. Make the smallest coherent change; avoid unrelated formatting, generated
   output or opportunistic refactoring.
6. Run `python tools/check.py` before every push. All gates must pass.
7. Update the affected documentation and add a user-facing entry under
   `## [Unreleased]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
8. Review the complete diff, then open a pull request **against the release
   branch** with evidence and explicit limitations.
9. Merge only after review, with the **Repository integrity** check green and
   every review finding resolved.

Nothing is committed directly to the release branch or to `main`. Integration
of the release branch into `main` happens only on the owner's request; see
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md). Pushed history on a shared branch is never
rewritten: no rebase, amend or force-push. Bring `main` in with a merge commit.

### Commit messages

Use a conventional subject line, for example `fix: …`, `docs(plan): …`,
`test: …` or `fix(ci): …`, then a body that states:

- **what** changed;
- **why** it changed; and
- **what was validated** at that commit, separating static checks from Excel
  runs, and stating plainly what was **not** validated.

Reference the issue when one exists. Do not place credentials, private links,
attribution boilerplate or unverifiable test claims in commit messages.

## 📦 Source-change discipline

The repository-control files define how source is stored:

- exported VBA (`.bas`, `.cls`, `.frm`) is the reviewable source of truth. It
  is stored with LF in Git and checked out with CRLF;
- component filenames match their `VB_Name`, and every module declares
  `Option Explicit`;
- `.frm`/`.frx` pairs stay together, and `.frx` stays binary;
- workbooks and add-ins are generated artifacts, ignored by Git unless an exact
  path is re-included; a workbook is never the only record of a source change;
  and
- test data and examples are synthetic.

`python tools/check.py` enforces storage, naming, placement and
`Option Explicit`, plus the VBA jump, conditional-compilation and public-API
checks. Component placement, the dependency direction (`src/workbook/` →
`src/modules/` → `src/core/`) and the public-API boundary are defined in
[`docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md); supported
declarations are listed in [`docs/PUBLIC_API.txt`](docs/PUBLIC_API.txt). Naming,
contracts, errors and Excel-state handling follow
[`docs/VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md`](docs/VBA_HOUSE_STYLE.md).

Do not weaken a calculation, numerical or packaging gate merely because the
generic repository gate passes.

## 🔄 Compatibility and model contracts

A change to documented procedures, functions, classes, enums, parameters,
defaults, return values, errors, side effects, input or output layouts,
parameter-export formats or supported platforms is a contract change. So is any
change that alters an estimated coefficient, stable share, decay profile, mean
life or backtest statistic for the same inputs and settings.

Such a contribution must identify callers and migration impact, update
regression coverage, update the user documentation and state the release
impact. A methodology change must also cite the source it implements and record
it in [`docs/methodology/`](docs/methodology/README.md).

Statistical estimators carry extra obligations:

- **independent numerical reference cases** with stated tolerances;
- **documented failure behavior** for non-convergence, separation, singular
  designs and insufficient data;
- **convergence and reproducibility** settings recorded with the result; and
- **no look-ahead**: backtesting must never use information unavailable at the
  forecast date.

Excel and Windows state belongs to the caller or host unless a component
explicitly owns it. Capture before mutation, restore only state successfully
changed and still owned, and never let cleanup conceal the original failure.

<a id="validation-and-evidence"></a>

## 🧪 Validation and evidence

Validation must be reproducible from the exact source under review. Record:

```text
Source
------
Commit:
Files or components changed:

Environment
-----------
Excel / Office build:
Office bitness:
Operating system:
Locale / date system:

Checks
------
python tools/check.py:
Compile (Debug → Compile VBAProject):
Regression harness:
Reference cases and tolerances:
Specific scenario verified:
Cleanup:

Limitations
-----------
Not run or unverified:
Follow-up:
```

Use only the applicable fields, but never omit a material limitation.

- **Static checks are not Excel evidence.** `tools/check.py` and the hosted
  workflow inspect files. They do not compile VBA, run Excel or validate any
  model. Evidence bound to an exact commit follows
  [`docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md).
- **VBA changes are not merged until verified in Excel:** compile, run the
  harness, and exercise the specific scenario the change addresses. State
  plainly what was and was not run in Excel.
- **A skipped check is not a pass.**
- **Reference values must be independent** of the implementation under test,
  for example a published worked example or an independent statistical
  package. A model must never validate itself.

## 🚀 Pull requests

A pull request answers five questions:

1. What problem does this solve?
2. What observable contract changes?
3. What remains compatible?
4. How was the exact source validated?
5. What remains unverified?

### Review checklist

- [ ] The PR targets the active release branch, and the related issue is linked.
- [ ] Scope is focused; model, API and compatibility impact are assessed.
- [ ] Exported VBA and required binary companions are synchronized.
- [ ] `python tools/check.py` passes, and the **Repository integrity** check is green.
- [ ] Excel compile, harness and scenario results are recorded for VBA changes.
- [ ] Estimator changes carry independent references, tolerances and failure cases.
- [ ] Documentation and the `[Unreleased]` changelog entry are updated.
- [ ] No confidential, real-portfolio, accidental binary or generated material is added.
- [ ] Unverified environments and skipped checks are stated plainly.
- [ ] The final diff contains no unrelated formatting or local artifacts.
