## ✨ Purpose

**VBA-IRRBB-Toolkit** is an Excel/VBA **application project** intended to develop transparent, independently testable tools for behavioral assumptions in Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). It addresses the modelling of non-maturity deposits (NMDs) and, where applicable, demand-side balances, with an emphasis on reproducible calculations, model risk management and ALM parameter export.

The planned scope has three distinct model families:

| Model | Question answered | Intended techniques |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Interest-rate model** | How do administered customer rates respond to market rates? | Long-run relationship, error-correction dynamics (ECM), asymmetric pass-through, OLS and specification tests |
| **Stable amount model** | What portion of demand balances is expected to persist over a chosen horizon? | Cash-out / survival estimation, binomial-logit GLM, account or cluster predictors, rate-dependent scenarios |
| **Decay model** | How does the stable component amortize over time? | Log balance-change dynamics, volatility, minimum-probable-amount profiles, mean life and maturity constraints |

Planned cross-cutting functionality includes data validation, calibration, historical out-of-sample backtesting, scenario sensitivity, diagnostics, versioned parameter sets and controlled export for downstream ALM platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The models above are **design objectives**, not implemented or independently validated features. Methodological choices, econometric assumptions, statistical tests and regulatory constraints require explicit documentation and numerical validation before use. In particular, a statistical decay horizon does not by itself establish regulatory compliance of an IRRBB repricing profile.

## 🧭 Status

**v0.1.0 – Repository foundation (in progress).** This initial milestone establishes source layout, documentation, issue governance, CI and static source checks; it does **not** deliver pricing, econometric fitting, a production workbook or certified IRRBB outputs.

- Application profile: an Excel workbook will be the end-user deliverable, assembled from reviewed exported VBA source.
- Production calculations will live in `src/core/` without direct Excel object dependencies.
- `src/modules/` will expose a documented public facade; `src/workbook/` will contain host glue only.
- `tests/` will hold synthetic test cases and expected results; evidence from a real Excel run must be separately recorded.
- No client data, confidential third-party material, vendor source code or customer-specific models are allowed in Git; the repository and its history are public.

## 🛠️ Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-IRRBB-Toolkit.git
cd VBA-IRRBB-Toolkit
git switch release/v0.1.0
python tools/check.py
```

Git and Python 3.10+ are needed for the static checks. A Windows 64-bit Excel host is intended for future workbook import, compile and execution. **Passing Python checks does not imply VBA compilation or model validation.**
