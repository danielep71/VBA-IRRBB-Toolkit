This register is authoritative for **which external sources the toolkit relies
on and whether each has been verified against its official text**. Model
contracts in [`MODEL_CONTRACTS.md`](MODEL_CONTRACTS.md) cite sources by ID.
Sources are cited by reference only; their text is never copied into the
repository.

> [!WARNING]
> `REG-1` and `REG-3` were verified on 2026-10-08 by the owner's research
> against the official BIS and EUR-Lex texts, for the provisions listed in
> [Verification record](#verification-record). `REG-2` and the econometric
> sources are not verified. A regulatory rule may be implemented only from a
> verified provision, recorded with its exact location and version.

## ✅ Verification record

Verified on 2026-10-08 by the owner's research, using only the publishers' own
websites (bis.org, eur-lex.europa.eu). Page numbers are printed pages.

| Source | Provision | Verified content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REG-1` | ¶111, pp. 25–26; SRP31.108 | NMDs are segmented into retail and wholesale; categories *Retail/transactional*, *Retail/non-transactional*, *Wholesale*. Retail covers individuals, plus small businesses managed as retail with aggregate liabilities below EUR 1 million; transactional accounts have regular transactions or bear no interest; wholesale covers legal entities, sole proprietorships and partnerships |
| `REG-1` | ¶113, Table 2, p. 26; SRP31.110–31.112, Table 4 | Cap on the proportion of core deposits: 90 %, 70 %, 50 % |
| `REG-1` | ¶114 | Non-core deposits are placed in the overnight bucket |
| `REG-1` | ¶115, Table 2, p. 26; SRP31.111–31.112, Table 4 | Cap on the average maturity of core deposits: 5, 4.5 and 4 years |
| `REG-3` | Title, OJ header p. 1; Article 6, p. 5 | Number 2024/856, adopted 1 December 2023, OJ L 24.4.2024; in force on the twentieth day after publication (14 May 2024) |
| `REG-3` | Article 1(1)–(2), p. 2 | EVE scenarios: parallel up, parallel down, steepener, flattener, short rates up, short rates down; NII scenarios: parallel up, parallel down |
| `REG-3` | Article 3(7), p. 4; Article 4(1), p. 5 | Post-shock lower bound $\min(-150 + 3m,\ 0)$ basis points at maturity $m$ in years (rising by 3 basis points per year), replaced by the observed rate where lower; extended to NII by Article 4(1) |
| `REG-3` | Articles 1–6 and Annex, pp. 2–7 | **No** cap on the average repricing maturity of non-maturity deposits |

Not yet verified: `REG-2` in full (the official EBA texts could not be opened),
including the EU 5-year cap on NMD repricing maturity, its scope and the
guidelines' exact title and application dates; and the `REG-3` shock sizes per
currency.

The toolkit's own session could not open these sites (network policy), so the
record above rests on the owner's research and was not re-checked here.

## Verifying an entry

1. Obtain the official text from its publisher.
2. Record the exact title, version or publication date, and the article,
   paragraph or table relied on.
3. Check every figure or rule the contracts attribute to it.
4. Mark the entry verified in a reviewed change that names the reviewer, and
   correct the contracts where they differ.

A source that cannot be obtained stays unverified, and anything resting on it
stays a proposal.
