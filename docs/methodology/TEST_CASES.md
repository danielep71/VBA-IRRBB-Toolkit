# 🧮 Numerical Test Cases

### Registered reference cases for every model, with independent provenance and tolerances

This register is authoritative for **which numerical cases test each model, where
their expected values come from, and how closely the toolkit must match them**.
The models are specified in [`MODEL_CONTRACTS.md`](MODEL_CONTRACTS.md); the
evidence protocol is in [`VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](VALIDATION_PLAN.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The model cases below are **registered, not built**. The data contract cases
> are *built*: their fixtures and expected files exist and are checked on every
> run of `python tools/check.py`. Cases marked *Built (VBA)* have a VBA
> implementation run by `TEST_Harness.RunTests` in Excel; their literal
> expectations are checked without Excel by `tools/test_vba_harness.py`. No
> Excel run is recorded yet. A case moves to *built* when its fixture and
> expected file are committed with their provenance; the harness registry in
> `tests/modules/TEST_Harness.bas` lists every ID here, in this order.

## 🔎 Provenance rules

- Expected values are produced **outside the toolkit**: by hand, from a
  published worked example, or by an independent package run offline
  ([runtime dependencies](../../INSTALLATION.md#runtime-dependencies)).
- Each expected file records the producing tool and its version, the script or
  steps used, the date, and the person who produced it. A script that produces
  reference values is committed next to the expected file.
- Fixtures are synthetic. A fixture generated from a known process records the
  process, its parameters and its seed.
- An expected value is never copied from toolkit output. If the toolkit and the
  reference disagree, the disagreement is investigated, not the reference
  edited.

## 📏 Tolerances

| Kind | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `exact` | Identical after the stated rounding; used for counts, codes and hand-constructed identities |
| `abs ε` | $\lvert x - x_{ref} \rvert \le \varepsilon$ |
| `rel ε` | $\lvert x - x_{ref} \rvert \le \varepsilon \cdot \max(1, \lvert x_{ref} \rvert)$ |

Tolerances reflect numerical method differences only (for example QR versus
normal equations, or iteration stopping rules), never sampling error. A test of
whether an estimator recovers a known data-generating process is a separate,
statistical check, not a tolerance test.

## 📋 Register

### Harness

| ID | Checks | Reference | Tolerance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HARN-OUT-01` | Case outcome rules (`NOT RUN`, `ERROR`, `FAIL` with no assertion, `PASS` only when every assertion passes) and the `abs`, `rel` and `exact` tolerance kinds | Rules on this page; expectations re-derived by [`test_vba_harness.py`](../../tools/test_vba_harness.py) | `exact` | Built (VBA) |

### Data contract

| `DATA-PARSE-02` | Balances (4 places) and rates (8 places, −0.05 to 0.25) (`CORE_ParseDecimal`, `CORE_ParseRate`): missing versus invalid, locale-like forms rejected | As `DATA-PARSE-01` | `rel 1e-15` balances; `exact` rates and codes | Built (VBA) |
