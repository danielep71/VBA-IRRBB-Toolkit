All notable changes to the **IRRBB Toolkit** are documented here.

This changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). It records
released behavior and material unreleased changes; it is not a commit log, issue
tracker, or substitute for release evidence.

---

## 🧭 Maintenance policy

- Add material changes under **Unreleased** in the same pull request as the
  behavior or documentation they describe.
- Write from the user's perspective: describe the observable result, contract,
  compatibility impact, and migration need.
- Link the owning issue or pull request when it contains useful engineering
  detail.
- Record only validation actually performed. Static checks are never Excel
  evidence; state what was and was not run in Excel.
- Record any change to estimated parameters, stable shares, decay profiles or
  backtest statistics for unchanged inputs, with its cause.
- Move Unreleased entries into a dated version section only when a release is
  explicitly prepared.
- Do not edit a published release entry except to correct a demonstrable factual
  or link error; annotate material corrections instead of rewriting history.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for change and evidence requirements and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting.

### Date and version rules

| Rule | Standard |
|---|---|
| Version | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, without the leading `v` in headings |
| Release heading | `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Date | Gregorian calendar date in ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| Ordering | Unreleased first; released versions newest to oldest |
| Comparison | Unreleased → latest tag; each release → preceding tag |
| Patch | Backward-compatible correction or hardening |
| Minor | Backward-compatible capability |
| Major | Incompatible public-contract change |

The repository remains below `1.0.0` while its supported surface is still
forming. Pre-release status does not excuse undocumented breaking changes.
`python tools/check.py` enforces these rules and the match with `VERSION`.

## [Unreleased]

> Not yet released. Development takes place on the active release branch,
> `release/v0.2.0`; changes to `main` require an explicit owner instruction.

### Added

- Daily repository traffic export with history on a separate branch,
  main-only analytics access, and traffic alerts, following the SA-CCR
  repository setup.
  Setup and verification are documented in `docs/TRAFFIC.md`.

- `tools/check_source.py` rejects Excel object-model and UI identifiers
  (`Range`, `Cells`, `Application`, `MsgBox` and others) in `src/core/` code,
  ignoring comments and string literals, so the model core stays
  host-independent; covered by `tools/test_core_boundary.py` (#2).

- Initial repository foundation for a source-first Excel/VBA IRRBB behavioral
  modeling application.
- Documentation of model scope, validation requirements, source boundaries and
  synthetic-data policy.
- Portable static-checking tools and CI configuration adapted from the
  maintainer's SA-CCR repository.
- Automatic issue owner/milestone/priority reconciliation, including closed issues;
  traffic alerts select an explicit configurable milestone. Ruff/mypy settings
  are documented as optional development targets, not claimed CI gates.

### Changed

- The repository is now licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0
  (MPL-2.0) instead of MIT (#49). `LICENSE` holds the MPL-2.0 text and is the
  license notice for every file; contributions are accepted under MPL-2.0.
  Copies obtained before the change keep the MIT License.
- The active release branch is now `release/v0.2.0`, opened from `main` when
  milestone v0.1.0 closed (#55). Documentation and the PR template point to
  it. `release/v0.1.0`, opened after the foundation was integrated (PR #13),
  carried the foundation work; release branches are named `release/vX.Y.Z`.

### Security

- `.gitignore` now keeps local data, extracts, snapshots and parameter
  exports out of Git (rooted `private/`, `local-data/`, `extracts/`,
  `snapshots/`, `exports/` and `parameter-exports/` folders), ignores binary
  data, statistical-package and archive formats, and covers more key and
  credential files. Synthetic CSV and JSON fixtures stay trackable (#11).

### Removed

- The one-off `Bootstrap v0.1.0 tracking` workflow and
  `tools/bootstrap_tracking.py`. The v0.1.0 milestone and issue metadata they
  created remain; the workflow no longer runs with `issues: write` on every
  push to the release branch.

### Documentation

- Translate all milestone guides into US English and establish US English
  as the repository language standard. Standardize surrounding documentation
  while preserving glyphs, navigation, technical scope, and official source
  titles.

- Detailed milestone guides in `docs/Milestones/`, one per milestone
  from v0.1.0 through v1.0.0, with a navigation index, purpose, deliverables,
  dependencies, synthetic examples and completion evidence. Implementation
  tracking gaps are explicit; the guides do not change model contracts or
  assert that planned functions are delivered.
- The v0.1.0 guide records the milestone as closed on 2026-10-09: each
  deliverable links its issue and the document where it lives, the
  distribution review (#42) and MPL-2.0 relicensing (#49) are included, and
  the completion criteria are marked met. The status sections of README,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `INSTALLATION.md` and `RELEASING.md` now name v0.2.0 as
  the active milestone.
- `docs/FOUNDATION_CLOSEOUT.md` records the v0.1.0 closeout: every checklist
  item is marked met with the evidence it rests on.

- Root documents (`CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `INSTALLATION.md`, `RELEASING.md`, `SECURITY.md`) expanded to the
  maintainer's documentation standard, with headers, badges and complete
  workflow, evidence, security and release sections.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains a "Data, confidentiality and provenance" section:
  what counts as synthetic, private visibility is not permission, no
  third-party code or restricted manuals without rights, provenance in every
  PR, and what to do if sensitive material is committed. `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`
  adds a licensing and distribution gate with a full-history scan procedure
  (#11).
- The architecture, validation plan and feature issue form refer to a
  generic downstream ALM platform instead of a named vendor product (#11).
- Model contracts accepted (#9) in `docs/methodology/MODEL_CONTRACTS.md`:
  rate pass-through (unit roots, Engle-Granger long run and cointegration,
  symmetric and asymmetric ECM, constraints rejected not clipped), stable
  amount (one-month survival share, balance-weighted fractional logit,
  predictors known at the forecast date, convergence and separation
  failures) and decay (log changes, prudential drift, minimum probable
  amount, conserved profile, mean life), with segment granularity,
  out-of-sample freeze, confidence bands, scenarios, and the regulatory
  overlay kept separate from the fit. `SOURCES.md` registers the cited
  sources: BCBS d368 (core-deposit categories and caps) and Delegated
  Regulation (EU) 2024/856 (outlier-test scenarios and floor) verified,
  EBA/GL/2022/14 not yet; `TEST_CASES.md` registers the numerical
  reference cases with provenance rules and tolerances.
- Data contract accepted (#4) in `docs/methodology/DATA_CONTRACT.md`: account
  panel and market-rate field dictionaries with types, units and null policy;
  segment codes `RET_TX`, `RET_NTX`, `WHS_NFC`; reconciliation; all-or-nothing
  import with error codes `E01`–`E11` and warnings `W01`–`W06`; gaps,
  openings, closures, migrations, outliers and look-ahead; CSV streaming for
  panels beyond worksheet limits; and lineage. Synthetic fixtures with
  hand-computed totals and warnings are checked by `tools/test_data_contract.py`.
- Supported hosts decided (#3): Windows 64-bit Microsoft 365 or Excel 2016+
  is the supported target, 32-bit is best effort (kept compiling, not
  certified), Mac, web and Excel 2013 or earlier are not supported. Only the
  four default VBA references are allowed, and the workbook has no runtime
  dependency beyond Excel; Python or R may produce reference values offline.
  `INSTALLATION.md` separates these commitments from test evidence, and
  `docs/EXCEL_EVIDENCE.md` defines the clean-build, compile, smoke-run,
  failure-path and cleanup stages, their outcomes and per-bitness rules.
- `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` rewritten as the architecture, accepted by
  the owner: profile rationale, the intended Excel workflow, layout,
  dependency direction, public API boundary, canonical units at the facade,
  immutable versioned parameter sets and intentional non-goals (#2).
- Owner-approved v0.1.0-to-v1.0.0 roadmap: workbook/import/harness work moves
  to v0.2.0, with all Excel obligations retained; model-contract amendments
  are split into milestone-specific prerequisites (#26, #32-#37). Independent
  benchmarks accompany each model, and Stable-Decay composition is explicit.
- Accepted host/data/model records now have direct evidence links; unresolved
  model interpretation and reproducibility requirements are tracked in #26.
- `RELEASING.md` describes integration through pull requests only: always
  open it from an integration branch (never the release branch, which would be
  deleted on merge), bring a moved `main` into it first, merge into `main`
  with a merge commit, and bring the release branch level with a second PR
  from `main`, also merged with a merge commit.
- Documentation prepared for public visibility (#42): `SECURITY.md` routes
  reports through GitHub private vulnerability reporting, with email as the
  fallback; `docs/TRAFFIC.md` states that the traffic branch is public and
  holds aggregate counts only; README, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md` and
  the foundation closeout no longer assume a private repository, and public
  visibility is recorded as an owner decision separate from any release.

### Fixed

- Label commands now default to the checked-in `.github/label-policy.json`.
- Workbook package checks reject missing core parts and archive corruption;
  these structural checks do not certify Excel compatibility.
- Traffic history labels the repository count `open_issues_and_prs`, including
  pull requests, and preserves values when migrating the old CSV column.
- Traffic alert issues are now created in the repository's single open
  milestone, so every issue carries a milestone; the run fails if there is
  no open milestone or more than one.
- The data-contract reference check applies the cross-row history rule
  (`E11`) before duplicate (`E05`) and currency-change (`E08`) rules and to
  every affected row, as `DATA_CONTRACT.md` orders them; duplicates and
  currency changes no longer hide inconsistent account dates.
- Repository audit corrections (#25): shared VBA comment/continuation lexer,
  exact workbook path and encoding-independent XML reference checks, stronger
  account/market fixture validation, and reconciliation without premature rounding.
- Core-boundary checks now reject `CreateObject` and `GetObject`, including
  variable or concatenated ProgIDs that could previously hide Excel access.
  External COM automation belongs in host adapters; these names are reserved
  in core code even for non-Excel objects. Comments and strings remain allowed
  ([#22](https://github.com/danielep71/VBA-IRRBB-Toolkit/issues/22)).
- Continued comments now recognize VBA whitespace, including tabs, and require
  the continuation underscore immediately before the newline.

### Known limitations

- No VBA source, workbook, regression harness or model engine exists yet.
- No automated check compiles VBA, runs Excel or validates a model; passing CI
  is not evidence of correct IRRBB calculations.
- The methodology is a roadmap, not a validated specification, and its
  regulatory reference register is not yet populated.
