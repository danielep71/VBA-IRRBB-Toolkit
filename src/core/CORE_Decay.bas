' CORE_Decay
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Decay model of docs/methodology/MODEL_CONTRACTS.md (accepted in #9):
'   log balance changes with declared impulse breaks, prudential drift,
'   minimum probable amount (MPA), conserved runoff profile, core / non-core
'   split, mean lives, diagnostics, and the out-of-sample exceedance score
'   with frozen parameters.
'
' METHOD
'   g(t)   = ln B(t) - ln B(t-1), t = s+1..e (consecutive month ends, B > 0)
'   g(t)   = mu + sum_k kappa_k D_k(t) + e(t)                      (OLS)
'   sigma  = sqrt(SSR / (n - 1 - K)); mu* = min(mu, 0); z = Phi^-1(1 - c)
'   MPA(h) = B(e) exp(mu* h + z sigma sqrt(h)),  h = 0..H
'   o(h)   = MPA(h-1) - MPA(h), h = 1..H; remainder MPA(H) at month H
'   L      = (sum_h h o(h) + H MPA(H)) / B(e)                     (months)
'   Lcore  = (sum_{h>=2} h o(h) + H MPA(H)) / MPA(1)              (months)
'
' IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES NOT FIXED BY THE CONTRACT (to be confirmed, #26)
'   - A break date is the month end at which the affected log change ends.
'   - The median path reported alongside is B(e) exp(mu* h), i.e. the same
'     prudential drift with z = 0.
'   - Residual autocorrelation: Ljung-Box Q with 12 lags, chi-square(12).
'     Normality: Jarque-Bera with population moments, chi-square(2).
'     Empirical quantile: Hyndman-Fan type 7 of e / sigma at 1 - c.
'   - Backtest pairs use horizons 1..maxHorizon with both origin and
'     realisation inside the test window (T_e, T_f].
'
' CONTRACT
'   Dates are VBA Date values at month end, ascending; balances in currency
'   units; shares in [0, 1]; horizons and mean lives in whole/fractional
'   months. The model has no rate input: rate scenarios cannot reach it.
