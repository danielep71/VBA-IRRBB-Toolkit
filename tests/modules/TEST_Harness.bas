Attribute VB_Name = "TEST_Harness"
'==============================================================================
' TEST_Harness  (in-Excel regression runner, issue #8)
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' PURPOSE
'   Runs every case registered in docs/methodology/TEST_CASES.md that has a VBA
'   implementation, with deterministic case IDs and assertion counts, and lists
'   every other registered case as NOT RUN. A failure is never shown as PASS.
'   The registry below mirrors the register in order; tools/test_vba_harness.py
'   fails if they differ. Case modules are reached through DispatchCase.
'
' OUTCOMES
'   PASS     every assertion of the case passed (and at least one ran)
'   FAIL     at least one assertion failed, or the case made no assertion
'   ERROR    the case raised an unexpected error (recorded as an assertion)
'   NOT RUN  registered, but no VBA implementation in this build
'
' STALE RESULTS AND ERRORS
'   Previous results are withdrawn before the run (status RUNNING). If the run
'   itself fails, the primary error and any cleanup error are both kept in the
'   status block.
'
' OUTPUT
'   Sheet "Checks": status block (rows 3-11), case table (A13:F), assertion
'   table (H13:N). Tolerances follow TEST_CASES.md: abs |x - r| <= eps,
'   rel |x - r| <= eps * max(1, |r|), exact x = r.
